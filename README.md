## HOW TO WRITE CODE

Please use following style/princeples:

    1) Use only dumb components (without business logic) in components folder
    2) Components should know how do they look like, not page that contains it
       It means - instead of redefining styles on every page - just make new type of button/input inside button/input component and just pass this type on your page
    3) Make pages small and readable as it possible (no need to make more than 40 lines of html inside page)
    4) If you need to make query - add it to a feature folder based on domain
    
    ** styles **
    5) All global scss variables should be declared in /src/styles/variables.scss
    6) Local variables in scss files should be computed based on global variables (example in footer/header components)
